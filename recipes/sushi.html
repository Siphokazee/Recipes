<h2>About Sushi</h2>
<p>Sushi is a Japanese culinary art form that combines vinegared rice with a variety of ingredients like seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. These ingredients are often rolled in seaweed (nori) or served atop small beds of rice. Sushi is known for its exquisite presentation, fresh flavors, and the delicate balance of textures, making it a beloved and internationally recognized cuisine. Whether enjoyed as traditional nigiri, creative rolls, or sashimi, sushi offers a delightful culinary experience that's both visually appealing and delicious.</p>
